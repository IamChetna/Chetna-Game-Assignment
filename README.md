# Chetna-Game-Assignment

I have made a game in which there is a ball which when touches the paddle bounces back and if touches the ground life decreases
and as life becomes 0 the game is over
If you are able to hit one brick which is of yellow color you will get 10 points 
if you hit red brick the, size of the brick reduces and no point is added
When you will hit all the yellow brick within 3 lifes "you won"
